We are curious about how the spread of COVID influenced crime stats. Previous time-series graphs have suggest several note-worthy trends in crime counts with respect to COVID cases, such as the fluctuant felony counts in early 2020. Nonetheless, those graphs suffer from messy presentations - multiple overlapping lines could hinder readers' interpretation.

Below is an interactive time-series line chart of crime counts by level together with COVID cases per 5 people.
