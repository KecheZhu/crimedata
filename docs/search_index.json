We believe that knowing the patterns of crimes can help establish more efficient ways to lower crime rates. Hence, we plan to collect crime data in NYC and attempt to solve these questions concerning the patterns of crimes: Does season have an impact on crime rates? Does crime rate fluctuate throughout the year in a certain pattern? What are the trends of crime rates in different areas and of different crimes? COVID is another factor that brings down people’s life quality. Could it also be another contributing factor for crime patterns besides space and time? If so, how does it affect crime rates? Does the outburst of COVID-19 contribute to spikes in crimes? Aiming to solve these questions, we will visualize and examine crime and COVID data from NYC’s 5 boroughs - Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. The data sets are provided by NYPD and NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Hopefully, we will be able to observe some valuable patterns and generate insight on how to deal with crimes.

Every entry is a crime report. Variables of interest include: borough, precinct, datetime, crime type(felony, misdemeanor, violation), crime sub-types (Ex. for felony: grand larceny, burglary, murder, etc.). We cleaned the data sets and extracted only reports after Jan 1, 2017. Total number of records after cleaning is 2106968. 2.2 Park crime data https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/crime-statistics/park-crime-stats.page This is a data set of crime counts in every park in NYC. It is recorded and published by NYPD. Each entry records the crime counts in one park. Variables of interest include: park, borough, crime counts by type (murder, rape, robbery, etc.). We combined park crime data from 2017 to 2021. Total number of records after cleaning is 114. 2.3 COVID data https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/trends/cases-by-day.csv This data set contains citywide and borough-specific daily counts of COVID cases. It is recorded and published by NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Each entry records the new COVID case counts on one day. Variables of interest include: date, case count. This data set includes data since February 29, 2020 based on the date that the Health Department classifies as the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in NYC. Total number of records is 648. https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/totals/by-boro.csv This data set contains citywide and borough-specific total counts of COVID cases. Each entry records the total COVID case counts in one borough. Variables of interest include: borough, case count. Total number of records is 6 (5 boroughs and citywide).

The first reason is that these data are safety related, and thus must be well documented in detail. The other reason is that we are focusing on relatively common features/columns, such as precinct, borough,crime type, and crime subtype. Some columns in raw data do contain missing values (Ex. latitudes and longitudes), but they are of little interest. Considering that the size of raw data is too large to present, we only use one of our cleaned data sets, park crime data, for demonstration here.

We plotted the daily crime counts from 2017 to 2021, and we were curious about: What is the annual pattern of different types of crime? Does the pattern fluctuates over years? Observations &amp; Analysis: There is a clear and stable annual pattern from 2017 to 2019: crime counts first increase and reach the highest level in the middle of a year. Then they gradually decrease to their original level at the beginning of each year. The average level of crime counts is stable over years. All three types of crime follow the pattern. However, the level of Misdemeanor at the very beginning of each year is dramatically high, and it drops to its normal level within a few days. There is a sharp decline of crime counts around March 2020. Although the annual pattern of “first increase then decrease” still holds after that, the overall level of crime counts has been increasing since then. We think that the pattern shown in 2017 - 2019 is the normal pattern while the fluctuations in 2020 and 2021 might be caused by COVID-19. The crime counts of Felony reach the highest level in 5 years soon after the steep decrease in March 2020. 5.2 Crime Reports in Relation to Boroughs We plotted the following bar charts to find clues about the relationship between crime data and different areas. Observations &amp; Analysis: Over the past 5 years, reported crime cases of NYC’s 5 boroughs have the following order: Brooklyn &gt; Manhattan &gt; Bronx &gt; Queens &gt; Staten Island. Crime count shows a decreasing trend in general. The ratio of felony cases with respect to total cases has been increasing since 2017. Observations &amp; Analysis: The crime rate displays a slightly different order: Manhattan &gt; Bronx &gt; Brooklyn &gt; Queens &gt; Staten Island. Manhattan becomes the most crime-dense area, with crime rate largely surpassing every other borough since 2017. We can still observe a decreasing trend, which is consistent with the previous graph. An interesting observation is that the number of felony reports remained relatively stable over the past five years (compared to the other two major levels). Thus, the ratio of felony cases with respect to total counts has shown an uprising pattern, in contrast to the trend of total crime counts. 5.3 Crime Counts vs COVID-19 Cases Here we plotted the daily crime counts in 2020 and 2021 together with COVID daily new cases in NYC to explore the impacts of COVID-19 on crime counts. We also plotted reductions in crime counts by borough, and compared it with total COVID cases by borough. Observations &amp; Analysis: The steep decrease in crime counts happens soon after COVID-19 breaks out in NYC. As COVID daily new cases reach the first peak and start to decrease, crime counts raise up. However, as COVID-19 breaks out again in 2021, there is little fluctuation in crime counts. Still, COVID has contributed to lower crime counts in the long run. The bar charts show that annual crime counts has dropped by large numbers since the beginning of 2020. Further, excluding Queens, reductions in felony &amp; total crime counts are approximately proportionate to total COVID cases. Our analysis is that: human activities were severely constrained due to the breakout of COVID-19, which led to the sharp decrease in crime counts. As the situation got better and people became active again, crime counts raised back to their original levels as a result. Since vaccines became available at the beginning of 2021 and people had already adapted to the existence of COVID-19, the second breakout of COVID had little impact on human activities including criminal behaviors. 5.4 Felony Counts vs COVID-19 Cases Felony counts has shown the most interesting pattern in the previous graph. Therefore, we decided to dive into the relationship between Felony Counts and COVID Cases. The plots above could not explain the sharp increase in Felony counts after the first breakout of COVID-19. We continued to analyze the patterns of Felony Counts in different boroughs. Observations &amp; Analysis: From the plot we can see that the breakout of COVID-19 has little impact on the felony counts in Staten island. Although there is an increase in the other 4 boroughs, only the felony counts in Manhattan boom to a dramatically high level. Observations &amp; Analysis: It is evident from the heat maps that average annual felony reports decreased after 2019. Nonetheless, there has been a big growth in burglary cases, as it became the third mostly reported felony. Observations &amp; Analysis: From the line chart of different felony types we can see more clearly that the sharp increase is mainly contributed by “Burglary”. Synthesizing the findings we have, we conclude that: the breakout of COVID-19 greatly constrained human activities and therefore caused economic difficulties for many people. As a result, some people would commit crimes once the situation got better. Burglary is one of the most straightforward way to get money and Manhattan is the richest borough in NYC. Therefore, most criminals chose to commit burglaries in Manhattan. 5.5 Park Crime Park Crime dataset consists of the counts of 7 major felonies that happened in parks and corresponding time and location information. Due to its outdoor nature, we believe that park crime should be highly correlated with seasons. Here we plotted the park crime counts in each quarter. Observations &amp; Analysis: From the plots we could see that park crime does have a very strong correlation with seasons. The count in the third quarter (summer) is the highest while the count in winter is the lowest, which is aligned with the pattern of human activities. Grand Larceny contributes to the largest portion of park crime counts and Robbery is the second. Among the 5 boroughs, Manhattan has the highest level of park crime counts. The breakout of COVID-19 also led to a sharp decrease in park crime counts, but was not followed up with a sharp increase. We think the reason is that human activities in many parks were still quite constrained even after the situation became better. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component We are curious about how the spread of COVID influenced crime stats. Previous time-series graphs have suggest several note-worthy trends in crime counts with respect to COVID cases, such as the fluctuant felony counts in early 2020. Nonetheless, those graphs suffer from messy presentations - multiple overlapping lines could hinder readers’ interpretation. Below is an interactive time-series line chart of crime counts by level together with COVID cases per 5 people. Clicking on the legend will show/hide the corresponding lines. You can choose any lines of interest to display and obtain an intuitive visualization of their relationship.

We observed a clear seasonal trend of crime cases: peaks and troughs come in summers and winters, respectively. We discovered that the patterns and ratios of crime of each type / in each borough remained stable during the past five years, and identified Manhattan as the most crime-dense area in NYC. From the inclusion of COVID data, we also recognized COVID’s inhibitory effect on crimes, in both the short run and the long run. While we are glad to be able to discover patterns of crimes, we are equally concerned about facts beneath these patterns. Reduced human activities in winter explains the seasonal patterns of crime, but what about patterns among the boroughs? What are the reasons that ratios of crimes in each borough could stay relatively stable? Our data offer little insight for these new questions - it would require stricter selections of data and further analysis to answer them. Moreover, our results enable us to see two sides of the coin named COVID. This everlasting pandemic has brought enormous damage to the society and to people’s lives; it is surely surprising to realize that COVID could have positive effects. Although crimes rebounded to the regular level towards ending of the first outburst, average crime counts has dropped on an annual scale. This fact inevitably leads us to ponder on the question that, have we done better in reducing crimes than a virus? The patterns and ratios of crimes appear to have strong stability, and thus we expect them to stay the same in the following few years. We also expect COVID’s effect on crimes to weaken quickly in the future, as people know better about the virus and treatments become more effective. Ultimately, the most important question for us is that should we get accustomed to these crime patterns and live with it, or should we take actions to reduce crimes.
