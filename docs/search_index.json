We can see in the graph that most rows have complete entries. Probable_cases, confirmed_cases, probable_death, and confirmed_death tend to have most missing values. This can be explained by variables consent_cases and consent_deaths; if no consent is given, cases and deaths data are left blank. Pnew_cases and pnew_death (numbers of probable cases &amp; deaths, respectively) also have missing values, very likely due to incomplete information in the four aforementioned columns. Fortunately, new_cases, total_cases, new_death, and total_death displays no missing data, so we can visualize trends of the spread of Covid with perfect continuity.
